- Started Project

- Working on Player.playerChanging(Player)
-- 1 May --
- Finished 1st edition of Player, Sport, SportTeam
- Finished *abstract* player changing schema
- + Sport calls for a change on SportTeam and SportTeam does the same with Player
- + Tried to create a simple schema open for adaptation to each sport still having utility within every sport
- + This schema lacks taking into account the position of each Player to rule if a change is within the rules of each sport
- + - Since the positions of each sport are defined in them, there's no possibility of abstraction using Java
- + - + Since the enums are not programmed to able to inherit other enums
- Created VolleyballPlayer * notFinished
